        %h1.text-center-xs.text-center-sm We like to try out lots of different ideas, <br class="hidden-xs">and we build a lot of apps for&nbsp;clients.

        %p The ruby community has tons of great gems out there that have saved a huge amount of time. But every time we started a project we found ourselves doing the same stuff over and over, figuring out exactly how we wanted to configure a particular gem for a particular problem. Even though we were more interested in creating a new product with particular functionality we were spending a lot of time doing&nbsp;"plumbing".

        %h2.text-centered.parenthesized.text-center
          Why not make it really easy to get through the plumbing, so we can focus on the part that makes the application different rather than the stuff that makes it the&nbsp;same?

        %h1.jumbo How?

      .right-col
        %h2 Install the gem

        %pre="$ gem install happy_seed"

        %h2 This creates the rails plugin on your system.

        %p
          There is a small application template that is used to start the app, which itself includes the happy_seed gem.  This exposes the rail generators and templates to your project, which is how functionality gets installed.

        %h2 Generate a new app
        %pre="$ happy_seed app_name"

        %h2 Now create!

        %p You will get prompted for what you want to install.

        %p Documentation for the current generators are:

        %h2 Start editing!

        %p The seed gem itself is a set of generators, and only that.  Functionality is either copied directly into your application, or included via a gem.

        %p Since a lot of the generators alter routes, when you destroy a generator (for example the splash page) it may not leave your routes in the correct state.

        %h2 Rails is very modular

        %p If you want to extract some functionality of your own application, rails plugins are the way to go. We like autotest and rspec, which was always tricky to configure, so we packaged that up to!

        %pre= "$ happy_seed_plugin acts_as_awesome"

        %p Or if you want to make an engine

        %pre= "$ happy_seed_plugin acts_as_awesome --mountable"
