## Rails Plugins & Engines

```sh
$ happy_seed plugin acts_as_awesome
```

The plugin generator runs `rails plugin new` and sets up a gem that can be used to extend Rails.  It sets up `rspec`, `factory-girl`, and `autotest` for testing.

```sh
$ happy_seed engines engine
```

This runs the plugin generator with the `--moutnable` flag.
