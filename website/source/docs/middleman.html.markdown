## Building sites with middleman

The two commands are:

```sh
$ happy_seed static site-name
```

Which will generate a static site using bootstrap-sass and haml.

```sh
$ happy_seed static_blog blog-name
```

Which will generate a static blog built off of the static site idea.

This is [documented in more detail elsewhere](http://willschenk.com/building-sites-with-middleman/).
