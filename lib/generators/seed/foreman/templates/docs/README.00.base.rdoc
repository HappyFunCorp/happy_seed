Seed Base Install
=================

### What does this do?

The seed application template sets up haml, meta-tags, disables turbolinks, and installs the seed generators into your application.

The seed:foreman generator installs dotenv-rails, unicorn, http site authentication, and the setup_controller.

/setup is used to see the seed documentation for each of the installed generators, and copies things into the rails doc directory.  The setup_controller is only visible locally.

### Why do you want this?

Haml is create and turbolinks make it impossible to correctly debug a site.

Using the .env file to manage configuration variables makes it much easier to keep track of what is needed in each environment, and sets you up to use heroku.

### Environment Variables

The AWS env variables are there for reference

If the HTTP_AUTH_U* variables are set, application_controller will force them to be used for authentication to let people into the site.  (The seed:splash generator will not use this.)

```
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
  S3_BUCKET_NAME=
  HTTP_AUTH_USERNAME=
  HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD=
```

### What needs to be done?

At some point, you should remove the setup_controller from your application.
